# duplicate-line
 
Command to duplicate a line or following selected lines

By default, in obsidian, without any selection, you can press <kbd>Ctrl C</kbd> and then <kbd>Ctrl V</kbd> to dupplicate line where the cursor is. 

With this plugin you can dupplicate the line where the cursor is, whatever the selection is and add your own shortcut as <kbd>Ctrl D</kbd> or <kbd>Shift Ctrl â†“</kbd> (as in Visual Studio Code) to do it

version 1.1:
multicursor and multiline selection now supported (same behaviour as Visual Studio Code)
