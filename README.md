# duplicate-line(s) / Add next occurence

New: 
Added the similar command to VSC, Add next occurence: 
each time you run the command it's adding the next occurence of the same word. if no selection will first select the word under cursor. 

Duplicate Line(s) Up/Down, duplicate selection Up/Down/Right/Left. Support Multicursor.    
    
if noSelection, duplicate line Up Down duplicates the whole line  
if noSelection, duplicate selection Right/Left duplicates the word before  
All commands can be enabled/disabled in settings
   
Another command, disabled by default, is a mix between duplicate line down and selection right.  
When no selection, duplicate down. when selection duplicate selection right. (feature request...)
