# duplicate-line-obsidian
 
Command to duplicate a line

<<<<<<< HEAD
By default, in obsidian, without any selection, you can press <kbd>Ctrl C</kbd> and then <kbd>Ctrl V</kbd> to dupplicate line where the cursor is. 

Whith this plugin? you can dupplicate the line where the cursor is, whatever the selection is and add your own shortcut as <kbd>Ctrl D</kbd> or <kbd>Shift Ctrl ↓</kbd> (as in Visual Studio Code) to do it  
<br>

Arrows ↑↓→←  

press <kbd>Ctrl Alt</kbd>+<kbd>↑ or ↓ or → or ←</kbd>

Well I discovered later that in obsidian, you can put the cursor anywhere on a line, and press <kbd>Ctrl C</kbd> and then <kbd>Ctrl V</kbd>.

But there you can choose a shortcut as  <kbd>Ctrl D</kbd> or  <kbd>Shift Ctrl ↓</kbd> (as in Visual Studio Code) if you are used to it.

So this first plugin I did in obsidian is not totally useless.
