Command to duplicate a line

Well I discovered later that in obsidian, you can put the cursor anywhere on a line, and press <kbd>Ctrl C</kbd> and then <kbd>Ctrl V</kbd>. 

It will duplicate the line. quite difficult to find.  

But there you can choose a shortcut as  <kbd>Ctrl D</kbd> or  <kbd>Shift Ctrl â†“</kbd> (as in Visual Studio Code) if you are used to it.

So this first plugin I did in obsidian is not totally useless.
